            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>These vegan stuffed mushrooms are filled with cashew cream, finely chopped mushroom stems, and nutritional yeast</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
                    <li>1 cup water (or more as needed)</li>
                    <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms</li>
                    <li>cooking spray</li>
                    <li>1 T vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
                    <li>1 t salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 t ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/4 t onion powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 t ground cayenne pepper</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak cashews in water for 1 to 2 hours. Drain.</li>
                    <li>Blend cashews with 1 cup water until creamy. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if needed to blend well.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully break off stems and reserve the caps. Chop stems very finely, discarding tough ends.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped mushroom stems and garlic to the skillet. Fry until any moisture has disappeared, taking care not to burn garlic, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Stir cashew cream, nutritional yeast, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the cooled mushroom mixture. Use a little spoon to fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of stuffing. Arrange the mushroom caps on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until mushrooms are piping hot and liquid starts to form under the caps, about 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
